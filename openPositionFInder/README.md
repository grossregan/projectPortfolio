A new job finder for Software Engineering and Data Science roles

## Getting Started

This project is a prototype for a new job finder.

To run the application, use Expo:
[Step by Step on starting expo]

# Application Overview
This job finder includes a custom search to efficiently find positions of interest, an intuitive dual-tab homescreen layout to sort positions by type, and the ability to favorite jobs of interest. To help you find the right fit, we have included the ability to compare two positions side-by-side by pressing and holding the job cards in question. In addition, you can find a convenient list of interview resources within the project for when you land the interview for your dream role.

# My Contribution
This was a team project!! In the interest of giving credit where credit is due, I built the homescreen, favorites page, interview resource page, and the respective API integrations for each of them. The remaining features were built by other team members.
